# How to apply?

Please check out our [repository](https://github.com/nordcloud/gsoc_ideas) of ideas!

In the repository you can find various kind of topics that we are eager to realize since we think
every each of them contributes to our tech society and open-source!

1.) Browse the list, read through the ideas and see if you like any of them.

2.) Read through carefully the requirements to see that it is a real fit to your skills! Note that
you don't need to know *everything* that is written there but the more you know the better the fit is.

3.) If you are interested in more than one try to prioritize your proposals starting with the one you want the most.

4.) Once you picked up the projects that you are interested in start writing a short proposal.

### What should be in your proposal?

* some words about yourself, why you like the idea, what your background is
* tell us why you are interested in Nordcloud projects
* list your relevant skills to the project, try to rank your knowledge on various topics
* if you have any previous experience relevant to the idea include that
* tell us about your time-zone so we can see when we could possibly sync
* include an email address where we can reach you out
* include your github profile if you have any projects from before
